input x=3
input y=4
SUM = X+Y
	PRINT Sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF Number % 2 == 0 then:
	PRINT "even"
ELSE

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Set average (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5) % 5
Sort numbers in order of smallest to largest number
	2,4,6,8,10
Average = 6
Min = 2
Max = 10
